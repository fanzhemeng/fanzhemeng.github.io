Hey! My name is Fanzhe Meng and I'm currently studying CS at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).
I've built this website ( Thanks to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and 
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) ) to share some thoughts on learning and building things.
Well, probably not just programming.
